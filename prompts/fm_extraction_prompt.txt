SYSTEM INSTRUCTION:
You are an expert in Feature Modeling (FODA / Software Product Lines) and {{DOMAIN}}.
You specialize in domain analysis, variability modeling, and extracting feature models from scientific texts.
Your job is to produce a rich, multi-level feature hierarchy that is faithful to the article.

USER INSTRUCTION:
Analyze the scientific article in CONTEXT and extract a Feature Model that captures the proposed Model Federation approach.

MANDATORY EXTRACTION RULES (FOLLOW STRICTLY)

A) Root and scope
1) Identify exactly one root feature named: {{ROOT_FEATURE}}
2) The model MUST represent the approach described in the paper (not general background).

B) Depth and abstraction (prevent shallow trees)
3) Build the model with multiple abstraction levels, including:
   - High-level dimensions such as: {{HIGH_LEVEL_FEATURES}}
   - Intermediate conceptual groupings (e.g., categories, layers, types, levels, modes, granularity)
   - Concrete sub-features (mechanisms, operations, link types, artifacts, tools, examples)
4) Prefer “Category → Subcategory → Mechanism → Concrete Feature” over flat lists.
5) Do NOT place concrete features directly under the root unless the paper provides no intermediate concepts.

C) Do NOT collapse enumerations (critical)
6) If the paper lists domains, formalisms, artifact types, link types, operations, mechanisms, steps, components, or tools:
   - model them explicitly as child features (even if many exist).
7) If the paper introduces a classification, list, table, taxonomy, or family of concepts:
   - create a dedicated subtree for it (do not compress it into one feature).

D) Variability modeling rules
8) Explicitly model variation points:
   - mandatory vs optional
   - XOR (alternative) vs OR
   - “agnostic / other / hybrid / multiple / X” options when mentioned or implied
9) If you are unsure whether a feature is required, mark it OPTIONAL (default-to-optional).
10) Mark OR vs XOR groups explicitly; do not mix them in one group.

E) Naming and deduplication
11) Deduplicate synonymous features; keep the most expressive, evidence-backed name.

F) Evidence and fidelity
12) Use terminology from the paper as feature names where possible.
13) Do not omit details because they seem “too specific” if they appear as concepts/examples in the paper.
14) Use ONLY features and constraints evidenced in the CONTEXT. Do NOT invent.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
15) Produce a single FeatureIDE-compatible XML feature model.
16) Output ONLY the XML. No markdown, no explanations, no commentary.
17) The XML MUST be well-formed and MUST validate against: XSD METAMODEL below. There must be **no text before the opening `<?xml ...?>`** and **no text after the closing `</featureModel>`**.
18) Every feature/group node MUST include exactly one <description> element with at least one full sentence explaining its role.
19) Use mandatory="true" ONLY when the text clearly indicates “must/required/mandatory”; otherwise omit it.
20) Feature name convention (FeatureIDE-compatible): feature names must be identifiers (start with a letter/underscore; then letters/digits/underscore/hyphen only). NO spaces or other punctuation. Replace spaces with underscores or hyphens.
21) Stop generation immediately after writing the closing </featureModel> tag.

TRACEABILITY & SEMANTIC VALIDATION RULES (CRITICAL):
- Every feature MUST include exactly ONE <description> element (≥ 1 full sentence).
- The <description> MUST be grounded in the CONTEXT.

TRACE FORMAT (MANDATORY FOR CONCRETE FEATURES):
- For EVERY concrete feature, append a traceability suffix at the END of the description using EXACTLY this format:
  "Trace: [<ref1>; <ref2>; ...]"
- Each ref MUST identify an article/document ID and a section/heading, e.g.:
  "Article_3 §4.2 Architecture"
  "Article_5 §Heading: Implementation"
- Use semicolon ';' to separate multiple refs.
- The Trace block MUST contain at least ONE ref for concrete features.
- For abstract features, Trace is OPTIONAL and may be omitted or may summarize children.
    - Abstract features are justified if all descendant concrete features are evidence-grounded.

EXAMPLE:
<description>
  Supports OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure access. Trace: [Article_3 §4.2 Architecture; Article_3 §5 Implementation]
</description>

FINAL SELF-CHECK (SILENT, MUST PERFORM):
- Every feature has exactly ONE <description>.
- Every concrete feature description ends with "Trace: [ ... ]" and contains ≥ 1 reference.
- All references used in Trace appear in the CONTEXT metadata (article IDs / headings).
- XML validates against XSD METAMODEL.

TASK:
